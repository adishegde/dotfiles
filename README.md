# Dotfiles

This is the customary dotfile repo maintained by anyone who's wasted a
**lot** of time customizing their editor and terminal.

**Note:** A lot of the initial configuration has been copied from other sources.
I wasn't in the habit of mentioning the sources at the time and so I apologize
if content has been copied without due credit.
